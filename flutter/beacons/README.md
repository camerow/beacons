# beacons

A beautiful crypto font pack for Flutter by Cryptowatch.

## Getting Started

Install beacons from pub.dev and import.

`import 'package:beacons/beacons.dart'`

`Beacon` is an `Icon` and can be rendered anywhere an `Icon` can be rendered.

### Usage

Simply:

```
Beacon('btc');
```

Change size/color of the icon:

```
Beacon('btc', size: 12, color: Colors.orange);
```

Use a circular icon style.

```
Beacon('btc', symbol: false);
```
